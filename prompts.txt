Initial Creation Prompts (Chronological)

1) "Iteratively build and deploy a complete e-commerce product page app with cart & checkout features, including frontend, backend, and database integration. Develop step by step: UI → Backend API → Database schema → Business logic. Must include product listing, cart management, checkout, confirmation page, deploy the full stack app on a public platform, and submit a .txt file capturing all creation prompts (excluding debugging). Explain prompt architecture (showcasing agentic AI / MCPs usage)."

2) "Scan existing backend, frontend, and compose files to understand current state before planning tasks."

3) "Create structured task list: connect backend to MongoDB and session store; create models and seed products; refactor cart endpoints to use session-backed cart; persist orders; add configurable API base; fix docker-compose paths; add deployment configs; create prompts log."

4) "Implement MongoDB connection, session storage, Mongoose models, product seeding, and update API endpoints accordingly."

5) "Centralize frontend API base via config.js and update all fetch calls to include credentials and use API base."

6) "Fix docker-compose paths (Backend/Frontend capitalization) and ensure environment variables are set."

7) "Add deployment configuration (Render web service + static site) and README with setup and deployment steps."
